// Package doc implements the `semiclaw doc` subtree (list / view / upload /
// fetch / create / download / delete / wait). Upload supports --recursive /
// --glob for bulk ingestion from local files. Fetch ingests a remote URL.
// Create adds a knowledge entry from inline text content.
//
// "Doc" is the CLI noun; the underlying SDK type is `Knowledge`. The renaming
// is deliberate: end-users think of a knowledge entry as the document they
// uploaded, not as an abstract knowledge unit. Mapping happens in this package
// only - the SDK surface and server API keep the original spelling.
